# DSA-WITH-PYTHON-ASSIGNMENT

This repository contains my assignment for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course, implemented using Python. The assignment focuses on various DSA concepts and problem-solving techniques, including divide and conquer, selection problems, linked list operations, sorting algorithms, hashing, and dynamic programming.

In this project, I have implemented efficient algorithms and data structures to solve a range of problems. These include divide and conquer algorithms for solving complex tasks by breaking them into smaller subproblems, selection problems involving finding the k-th element, operations on linked lists, efficient sorting algorithms, hashing techniques for faster data retrieval, and dynamic programming for solving optimization problems such as the rod cutting problem.
